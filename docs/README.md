# CFGen

CFGen is a lightweight file generator that creates `.h` or `.cpp` files from templates using custom and pre-registered macros like `/day`, `/date`, and `/time`.

**Usage:** Define a template → register macros → generate files instantly from the CLI.  
> **🔨 Status:** Under active development — features, macros, and structure are still evolving.
